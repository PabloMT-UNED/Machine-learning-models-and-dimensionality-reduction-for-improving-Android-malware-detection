**Machine learning models and dimensionality reduction for improving Android malware detection**

_Previous considerations_

First of all it is necessary to have the Jupyter Notebook package installed to run the programs.

You may need additional libraries, such as sklearn, pandas, numpy and the rest to be imported into the programs.

To run the programs, it is necessary to have the dataset loaded, which is not among the attached data in this repository*.

The folders ./in/dataset_splits and ./in/feature_vectors are essential for such execution. In the case of test mode execution, the folder ./in/feature_vectors_test is required, which is also not in the repository*.

*The dataset is property of the DREBIN project, which gave it disinterestedly to carry out the experiments, but we are not authorized to share this material.

The correct order of execution would be:
* ./bin/PROG1 - Sample selection and chi2 calculation.ipynb
* ./bin/PROG2 - Train and test of E1 and E2.ipynb
* ./bin/PROG4 - Normalizing metric data.ipynb
* ./bin/PROG3 - Validation.ipynb
	
It may be confusing because of the numbering, but since program 3 does not obtain the results dynamically, it is necessary to run program 4 so that it provides them in its last line.

Once program 3 has been executed, program 4 should be executed again to generate the final list, including all the experiments.

This problem will be corrected in future updates.

The results of the iterations are attached in the file ./out/metricas_finales.xls.
